    - name: Analysing the UST Yield Curve

      description: The Yield Curve (YC) is defined as the difference (spread) between the yield on 10-year T-Bonds and yield on 3-month (or 1-year) T-Bonds. In simpler terms, YC depicts a relationship between short-term and long-term rates of most safe financial securities: Treasury Bonds. During the last 60 years, it has been interesting that mostly all times that YC inverted (negative spread), after 12-24 months, a recession began in the US (except for one occasion). The graph shows that after a period of inverted YC (red colour), a recession (shadow area) followed (except in the 1960s). Nevertheless, the inverted Yield Curve cannot predict with certainty if it would occur a recession and the depth of the recession. For instance, the 2020 Recession was caused by COVID 19 Pandemic. Nevertheless, the graph shows that there was an inverted YC before the 2020 recession. Therefore, one must be careful when concluding economic phenomena just based on a chart.

      description: Given the current post-pandemic economy, many investors and businesses, in general, are very concerned with how inflation will impact the global economy. Although there is no consensus on how inflation will progress, some argue that the current uncontrolled inflation, that can be observed in most U.S. CPI components such as Food and Beverages, Apparel and Recreation. These components have yearly percent change considerably higher than in prior years is due to a mismatch in supply and demand caused by the global pandemic and the unexpected increase in demand, particularly from the United States. Also, these components are known to be quite cyclical, and given the current economic recovery, itâ€™s normal to assume they will suffer higher inflation.
